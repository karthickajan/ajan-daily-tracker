MIGRATION GUIDE: Update Device ID in Supabase
==============================================

Your old data is saved with device_id: device_v61uv3e3r
We're migrating to a fixed device_id: ajan_user

STEPS:
1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor: https://app.supabase.com/project/suxszrvczmdfajekqyrw/sql/new
2. Run this SQL command to update all old data:

-- Update old device_id to new fixed device_id
UPDATE tracker_entries 
SET device_id = 'ajan_user' 
WHERE device_id = 'device_v61uv3e3r';

3. Verify the migration:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tracker_entries WHERE device_id = 'ajan_user';

You should see your 2 rows of data now have device_id = 'ajan_user'

That's it! After this, your app will fetch all data correctly.
